As the founder of Distributed AI Research Institute (DAIR), she focuses mostly on power, governance, and accountability in AI, the issues that come into the fore when you’re handing more autonomy to agents. Her lens forces you to ask: are these systems actually helping my operations, or are they amplifying unseen risks?

For anyone leading operations, her work reminds us that ‘agentic’ doesn’t just mean autonomous, but should also mean responsible, inclusive, and transparent. It’s a different kind of systems thinking, one that doesn’t slow progress but makes sure it’s built on solid ground.

### Demis Hassabis – CEO, Google DeepMind

Demis works on AGI, and is responsible for AI breakthroughs such as AlphaGo, the first program to beat the world champion at the game of Go; and AlphaFold, which cracked the 50-year grand challenge of protein structure prediction.

What makes his work especially relevant for those thinking about agents is his focus on general-purpose intelligence. He’s not talking about narrow automations or isolated tasks, but systems that can learn, adapt, and reason across domains.

For anyone thinking about autonomy at scale, following Demis will help you stay in the know of what’s coming next, and a preview into the architectural leaps behind today’s most advanced agents. It’s not just research—it’s a signal of how fast the agentic age is moving.
