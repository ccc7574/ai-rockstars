## Meet 4 developers leading the way with AI agents

### Timothy Keyes

Timothy Keyes is a data scientist at Stanford Health Care and a combined MD and PhD candidate in cancer biology and biomedical informatics at Stanford University School of Medicine. He is using AI agents to put cancer patient info at cliniciansâ€™ fingertips, helping to alleviate administrative burden and speed up the workflow for tumor board preparation. His work involves autonomous AI agents that consult disparate data sources and collaborate on tasks like building chronological patient timelines, synthesizing literature, referencing treatment guidelines, sourcing clinical trials, and generating reports.

### Xavier Portilla Edo

Xavier Portilla Edo is the head of cloud infrastructure at Voiceflow, a platform that allows customers to create AI agents and conversational experiences without coding. He uses agent mode with GitHub Copilot to speed up development work, freeing developers to focus on other tasks while an agent works in the background.

### Amit Sethi

Amit Sethi is a principal architect at Microsoft. He works on AI agents that can automate tasks like analyzing client needs and generating code. He emphasizes the importance of agents in making developers more efficient and enabling them to focus on higher-level tasks.

### Rob Bos

Rob Bos is a principal software engineer at Microsoft. He is involved in developing AI agents that can assist with various aspects of software development, from understanding user requirements to generating and testing code. His work aims to make the development process more efficient and collaborative through the use of AI agents.
